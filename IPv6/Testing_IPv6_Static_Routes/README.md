## Objectives
- In this lab I'll be looking at directly attached, recursive, and fully-specified static IPv6 routes.
- 1111

## Setup
- Switch models / software versions.
- Any special interface notes (duplex changes, cost changes, etc).

## Steps Performed
Short list of what was done in the lab.  
(Keep this high-level. Details go in configs.)

## Verification
Include the important `show` commands you captured:
- `show spanning-tree`
- `show spanning-tree root`
- Anything that proves the concept.

## Expected Behavior
Describe what *should* happen and why the result makes sense.

## Files Included
- `configs/` – device configs  
- `outputs/` – command-output text files  
- `topology.png` – diagram
