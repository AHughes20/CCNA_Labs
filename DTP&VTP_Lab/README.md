## Objectives
- This lab demonstrates some key features about DTP and VTP.
- The nuke switch will wipe out the vtp domain.

## Setup
- VTP_Nuke_SW1 set to the same VTP domain with a higher revision number, but very different VLANs
- Observe how different DTP modes interact.

## Steps Performed
Short list of what was done in the lab.  
(Keep this high-level. Details go in configs.)

## Verification
Include the important `show` commands you captured:
- `show spanning-tree`
- `show spanning-tree root`
- Anything that proves the concept.

## Expected Behavior
Describe what *should* happen and why the result makes sense.

## Files Included
- `configs/` – device configs  
- `outputs/` – command-output text files  
- `topology.png` – diagram
